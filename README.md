# CS368-RPG-Final-Project
Source code for the final project. Code for TextureManager, Engine, and Tile largely based on RevTorA's tutorial found at http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/230524-c-tile-engine-from-scratch-part-1/
All other files are unused so far, but will likely be meshed with the SFML files once the graphics are completed
